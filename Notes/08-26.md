### What is a Computer? ###
- Different "avatars" of computer
	- Google Glass
	- Watch
	- Refidgerator
	- Drone
	- Sattelites
	- On and on and on

A simple view is:
Input devices -> (CPU and memory devices) -> Output devices

If we look a little deeper, the CPU has this stuff inside it:
- NIC
- GPU
- IO Card
- Processor
- On-Board Memory
- MIC
- Buses

The processor is like a general practitioner. They know a little of everything and will refer requests to "specialists" who take care of you.

### **A**rthmetic and **L**ogic **U**nit (ALU) ###
Probably the most important component in the computer. Why? It's the thing that _actually computes_.
- Provides the fundamental functionality of a computer
```C
void ALU (int &result, int op1, int op2, int oprn)
{
	switch (oprn) {
		case 0x20: result = op1 + op2; break;
		case 0x22: result = op1 - op2; break;
		case 0x2c: result = op1 * op2; break;
		case 0x24: result = op1 & op2; break;
		case 0x25: result = op1 | op2; break;
		deault: // do nothing
	};
}
```
So, with this, we see that the ALU is handling fundamental operations. As an engineer, we need to specify the number of bits on each variable, especially working with something like an ALU. For example, to present 9 operations or something, we need to have a minimum of 4 bits.
