Storage

### Registers ###
The fastest kind of memory.
- MIPS provides user accessible temp storage called registers
	- Limited in number
	- Very fast to access
	- Each of the register is 32-bit (word) long
	- Group of registers are called `register file`

You can write whatever you want to any register, but there are some common conventions to follow for registers:
- 0: Always zero, specified in hardware. Can't change
- 1: Assembler temp
- 2-3: Values for the function results and expression evaluations
- 4-7: Arguments
- 8-15: Temporaries
- 16-23: Saved temporaries
- 24-25: Temporaries
- 26-27: Reserved for OS Kernel
- 28: Global pointer
- 29: Stack pointer
- 30: Frame pointer
- 31: Return address

We also have a few special registers:
- Program counter
- Hi
- Lo

`Hi` and `Lo` are used for multiplication and division. This is because when you multiply two 32-bit numbers, you'll get a 64-bit number (which we'll need to registers to hold). Also, when you perform a division operation, you have two results, the division and the remainder. Hi an Lo are used for those as well.
