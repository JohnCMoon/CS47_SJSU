SJSU, CS47

### Why are we here? ###
This class is mostly about general computer systems. It wouldn't be unusual for other majors to be here, most industries would benifit from this info.

### Who's the instructor? ###

### Class Logistics ###
Office hours: M/W 4:30 pm - 5:45 pm in DH282

Use Canvas for correspondance [www.sjsu.edu/at/ec/canvas/]. Make sure it forwards to your email as well.

Get proof of equivalency to CS46B by 8/26. You'll be dropped otherwise.

All emails to instructor must have the subject line start with _[CS-47],01_ and be send to the SJSU email ID only. No 'hi' or 'hey' in emails. No first name basis. Emails should be professional. If formatted properly, you'll get a prompt response.

### Grading ###
There will be 2 homeworks and 1 project (worth big points). Submit project reports in IEEE format:[www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html].

Should include:
- Intro
- Requirement
- Design and Implementation
- Testing
- Conclusion

One midterm and the final exam (also worth big points).

Basically, work hard on the few assignments we have and nail the exams.

### Challenges ###
This ain't easy:
- Learning assembly programming
- Math... boolean algebra
- Drawing skills for logic schematics

Practice practice practice:
- Assembly programming (MIPS)
- Schematic/logic diagram drawing
- Math and boolean algebra
- Exam is all about brain to hand coordination
- 4x study time rule - need to spend 10hr./week at least outside class hour (shit...)
